# Approvals-OGX-Data-Fetcher
The function `fetchOpportunityApprovals_oGX` retrieves approved opportunities from AIESEC's GraphQL API within specified date and program filters. It collects data such as participant details (ID, name, home MC/LC), approval date, opportunity details (programme, title, duration, SDG goal), and slot dates. Upon fetching, it clears existing content in a specified Google Sheets tab and populates it with formatted data including mapped programme names and sub-products for different programs ('GV' and 'GTe'). This integration facilitates tracking and reporting on approved opportunities within the organization, supporting operational oversight and strategic decision-making processes.
